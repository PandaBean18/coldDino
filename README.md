## How it works?

* ColdDino allows users to upload a company email in the form of person[at]companyName[dot]com. It then parses the company name, and finds information about that company.
* It then uses a fine tuned model to create a summary of the company that explains why you want to work with them.
* The summary then gets added to your email template and is ready to be sent from your inbox.

## Points to note
* Application stores the templates in cookies, so the same templates do not persist from one device to other.
* The application has limited compatability with firefox as it treats whitespace differently causing issues while  creating templates.
